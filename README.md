## Hooks

### 1. Introducing

Hooks are a new feature that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class. They're released in React v16.7.0.

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes they let you use React without classes.

### 2. A Brief of Hook

**State Hook**

Renders a counter example. When you click the button, it increments the value:

Using React Hook

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- `useState` is a Hook, we call it inside a function component to add some local state to it.
- `useState` returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it, you can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else.
- `useState` has only one argument is the initial state, in the example above 0 is the initial state.

Using React Class

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    count: 0,
  }

  setCount = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setCount()}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Declaring multiple state variables.

You can use State Hook more than once in a single component:

```javascript
function withManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [name, setName] = useState('Brian');
  const [age, setAge] = useState(77);
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
}
```

React also provides a few built-in Hooks like `useState`. You can also create custom Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components. We'll look at the built-in Hooks first.

**Effect Hook**

You likely performe data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components using React lifecycle ( componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount ) in React classes. We call these operations "side effects".

The Effect Hook, `useEffect`, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as React lifecycle ( componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount ) in React classes, but unified into a single API.

Example, this component sets the document title after React updates the DOM:

Using React Hook

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

- When you call `useEffect`, you're telling React to run your "effect" function after flushing changes to the DOM.
- Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render including the first render.

Using React Class

```javascript
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    count: 0,
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
    window.addEventListener('resize', this.setCount);
  }

  setCount = () => {
    this.setState({
      count: this.state.count + 1,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setCount()}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Example, React would clean up `resize` event when the component unmounts, as well as before re-running the effect due to a subsequent render.

Using React Hook

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    // Clean up resize event
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    };
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Window width: {width}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Using React Class

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  state = {
    width: window.innerWidth,
  }

  UNSAFE_componentWillMount() {
    window.addEventListener('resize', this.handleResize);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', this.handleResize);
  }

  handleResize = () => {
    this.setState({
      width: window.innerWidth,
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Window width: {this.state.width}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Just like with `useState`, you can use multiple effect in a component:

Using React Hook

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Window width: ${width}`;
  });

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    // Clean up resize event
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    };
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Window width: {width}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Hooks let you organize side effects in a component by what pieces are related (such as adding and removing a event or subscription), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.

**Rules of Hooks**

Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

- Only call Hooks at the top level. Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Only call Hooks from React function components. Don't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks is your own custom Hooks.)

The better way you can use a [linter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) to enforce these rules automatically.

**Building Your Own Hooks**

Well, sometimes we want to reuse some stateful logic between components. Traditionally, there were two popular solutions to this problem: `higher-order components` and `render props`. Custom Hooks let you do this, but without adding more components to your tree.

Earlier on this page, we introduced a App component that calls the `useState` and `useEffect` Hooks to get window width and display on browser title. Let's say we also want to reuse this App logic in another component.

First, we'll extract this logic into a custom Hook called `useWindowWidth` and `useDocumentTitle`:

```javascript
function useDocumentTitle(title) {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = title;
  });
}

function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    // Clearn up
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    };
  });
  return width;
}
```

Now we can use it from the component:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const width = useWindowWidth();

  useDocumentTitle(`Window width: ${width}`);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Window width: {width}</p>
    </div>
  );
}


export default App;
```

The state of these components is completely independent. Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic, not state itself. In fact, each call to a Hook has a completely isolated state and so you can even use the same custom Hook twice in one component.

To build your own hooks you need to follow the `useSomething` naming convention. If a function's name starts with "use" and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook.

You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more we haven't considered.

### 3. Using the State Hook

#### What's a Hook?

What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features. For example, `useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components.

#### When would I use a Hook?

When would I use a Hook? If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component.

#### Hooks and Function Components

Function components in React look like this:

```javascript
const Example = (props) => {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
}
```

or this:

```javascript
function Example(props) {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
}
```

Hooks donâ€™t work inside classes. But you can use them instead of writing classes.

#### Declaring a State Variable

In a React class, we initialize the `count` state to `0` by setting `this.state` to `{ count: 0 }` in the constructor:

```javascript
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }
```

In a function component, we have no `this`, so we can't assign or read `this.state`. Instead, we call the `useState` Hook directly inside our component:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

What does calling `useState` do? 

  - It declares a "state variable". 
  - `useState` is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that `this.state` provides in a class.
  - Normally, variables "disappear" when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React.

What do we pass to `useState` as an argument? 

  - The only argument to the `useState()` Hook is the initial state.
  - Unlike with classes, the state doesn't have to be an object. We can keep a number or a string if that's all we need.
  - In the example above, we just want a number for how many times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for our variable.
  - If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call `useState()` twice.

What does `useState` return?
  
  - It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it.
  - This is why we write `const [count, setCount] = useState()`. This is similar to `this.state.count` and `this.setState` in a class, except you get them in a pair.

Now that we know what the `useState` Hook does, our example should make more sense:

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

We declare a state variable called `count`, and set it to `0`. React will remember its current value between re-renders, and provide the most recent one to our function. If we want to update the current count, we can call `setCount`.

#### Reading State

When we want to display the current count in a class, we read `this.state.count`:

```javascript
<p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
```
In a function, we can use count directly:

```javascript
<p>You clicked {count} times</p>
```

#### Updating State

In a class, we need to call this.setState() to update the count state:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
  Click me
</button>
```

In a function, we already have setCount and count as variables so we donâ€™t need this:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
  Click me
</button>
```

#### Overview

Let's now review what we learned line by line and check our understanding:

```javascript
 1:  import { useState } from 'react';
 2: 
 3:  function Example() {
 4:    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 5:
 6:    return (
 7:      <div>
 8:        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
 9:        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
10:         Click me
11:        </button>
12:      </div>
13:    );
14:  }
```

- Line 1: We import the `useState` Hook from React (It lets us keep local state in a function component).
- Line 4: Inside the Example component:
  - we declare a new state variable by calling the `useState` Hook. It returns a pair of values, to which we give names. 
  - We're calling our variable `count` because it holds the number of button clicks.
  - We initialize it to zero by passing `0` as the only `useState` argument. The second returned item is itself a function. It lets us update the count so we'll name it setCount.
- Line 9: When the user clicks, we call `setCount` with a new value. React will then re-render the Example component, passing the new count value to it.

#### What Do Square Brackets Mean?

You might have noticed the square brackets when we declare a state variable:

```javascript
const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('orange');
```

This JavaScript syntax is called "[array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#Array_destructuring)
". It means that we're making two new variables `fruit` and `setFruit`, where `fruit` is set to the first value returned by `useState`, and `setFruit` is the second. It is equivalent to this code:

```javascript
var fruitStateVariable = useState('banana'); // Returns a pair
var fruit = fruitStateVariable[0]; // First item in a pair
var setFruit = fruitStateVariable[1]; // Second item in a pair
```

When we declare a state variable with `useState`, it returns a pair of an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that lets us update it. Using `[0]` and `[1]` to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.

#### Using Multiple State Variables

Declaring state variables as a pair of `[something, setSomething]` is also handy because it lets us give different names to different state variables if we want to use more than one:

```javascript
function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('orange');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
```

In the above component, we have age, fruit, and todos as local variables, and we can update them individually:

```javascript
function handleOrangeClick() {
  // Similar to this.setState({ fruit: 'banana' })
  setFruit('banana');
}
```

### 4. Using the Effect Hook

The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This example is based on the counter example from the previous page, but we added a new feature to it: we set the document title to a custom message including the number of clicks.

Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all of side effects.

#### Using Effects Without Cleanup

Sometimes, we want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don't require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them. Let's compare how classes and Hooks let us express such side effects.

**Example Using Classes**

In React class components, the render method itself shouldn't cause side effects. It would be too early we typically want to perform our effects after React has updated the DOM.

This is why in React classes, we put side effects into `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. Coming back to our example, here is a React counter class component that updates the document title right after React makes changes to the DOM:

```javascript
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Note: We have to duplicate the code between these two lifecycle methods in class.

This is because in many cases we want to perform the same side effect regardless of whether the component just mounted, or if it has been updated. Conceptually, we want it to happen after every render. But React class components don't have a method like this. We could extract a separate method but we would still have to call it in two places.

**Example Using Hooks**

We've already seen this example at the top of this page, but let's take a closer look at it:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

What does useEffect do?

By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our "effect"), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API.

Why is useEffect called inside a component?

Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We donâ€™t need a special API to read it â€” it's already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.


Does useEffect run after every render?

By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update. (We will later talk about how to customize this.) Instead of thinking in terms of "mounting" and "updating", you might find it easier to think that effects happen "after render". React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.

**Detailed Explanation**

Now that we know more about effects, these lines should make sense:

```javascript
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
```

- We declare the count state variable, and then we tell React we need to use an effect.
- We pass a function to the `useEffect` Hook. This function we pass is our effect.
- Inside our effect, we set the document title using the `document.title` browser API. We can read the latest count inside the effect because it's in the scope of our function. 
- When React renders our component, it will remember the effect we used, and then run our effect after updating the DOM. This happens for every render, including the first one.

#### Using Effects with Cleanup

Earlier, we looked at how to express side effects that don't require any cleanup. However, some effects do. For example, we might want to set up a subscription to some external data source. In that case, it is important to clean up so that we don't introduce a memory leak. Let's compare how we can do it with classes and with Hooks.

**Example Using Classes**

In a React class, you would always set up a subscription in `componentDidMount`, and clean it up in `componentWillUnmount`. For example, let's say we have a ChatAPI module that lets us subscribe to a friend's online status. Here's how we might subscribe and display that status using a class:

```javascript
class FriendStatus extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOnline: null };
    this.handleStatusChange = this.handleStatusChange.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }

  handleStatusChange(status) {
    this.setState({
      isOnline: status.isOnline
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.isOnline === null) {
      return 'Loading...';
    }
    return this.state.isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
  }
}
```

Notice: how `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` need to mirror each other. Lifecycle methods force us to split this logic even though conceptually code in both of them is related to the same effect.

**Example Using Hooks**

You might be thinking that we'd need a separate effect to perform the cleanup. But code for adding and removing a subscription is so tightly related that `useEffect` is designed to keep it together. If your effect returns a function, React will run it when it is time to clean up:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    // Specify how to clean up after this effect:
    return function cleanup() {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
```

Why did we return a function from our effect?

  - This is the optional cleanup mechanism for effects.
  - Every effect may return a function that cleans up after it. 
  - This lets us keep the logic for adding and removing subscriptions close to each other.
  - They're part of the same effect!

When exactly does React clean up an effect?

  - React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts.
  - However, as we learned earlier, effects run for every render and not just once.
  - This is why React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time.

#### Overview


We've learned that `useEffect` lets us express different kinds of side effects after a component renders. Some effects might require cleanup so they return a function:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
  return () => {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
  };
});
```

Other effects might not have a cleanup phase, and donâ€™t return anything.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
});
```

#### Use Multiple Effects to Separate Concerns

One of the problems we pointed out in the Motivation for Hooks is that class lifecycle methods often contain unrelated logic, but related logic gets broken up into several methods. Here is a component that combines the counter and the friend status indicator logic from the previous examples:

```javascript
class FriendStatusWithCounter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0, isOnline: null };
    this.handleStatusChange = this.handleStatusChange.bind(this);
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }

  handleStatusChange(status) {
    this.setState({
      isOnline: status.isOnline
    });
  }
  // ...
```

Note: how the logic that sets `document.title` is split between `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`. The subscription logic is also spread between `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`. And `componentDidMount` contains code for both tasks.

So, how can Hooks solve this problem? Just like you can use the State Hook more than once, you can also use several effects. This lets us separate unrelated logic into different effects:

```javascript
function FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });

  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  // ...
}
```

Hooks lets us split the code based on what it is doing rather than a lifecycle method name. React will apply every effect used by the component, in the order they were specified.

#### Why Effects Run on Each Update

If you're used to classes, you might be wondering why the effect cleanup phase happens after every re-render, and not just once during unmounting. Let's look at a practical example to see why this design helps us create components with fewer bugs.

Earlier on this page, we introduced an example `FriendStatus` component that displays whether a friend is online or not. Our class reads `friend.id` from `this.props`, subscribes to the friend status after the component mounts, and unsubscribes during unmounting:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
    this.props.friend.id,
    this.handleStatusChange
  );
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
    this.props.friend.id,
    this.handleStatusChange
  );
}
```

But what happens if the friend prop changes while the component is on the screen?

 - Our component would continue displaying the online status of a different friend.
 - This is a bug.
 - We would also cause a memory leak or crash when unmounting since the unsubscribe call would use the wrong friend ID.

In a class component, we would need to add `componentDidUpdate` to handle this case:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
    this.props.friend.id,
    this.handleStatusChange
  );
}

componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  // Unsubscribe from the previous friend.id
  ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
    prevProps.friend.id,
    this.handleStatusChange
  );
  // Subscribe to the next friend.id
  ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
    this.props.friend.id,
    this.handleStatusChange
  );
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
    this.props.friend.id,
    this.handleStatusChange
  );
}
```

Forgetting to handle `componentDidUpdate` properly is a common source of bugs in React applications.

Now take a look at the version of this component that uses Hooks:

```javascript
function FriendStatus(props) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
```

It doesn't suffer from this bug. (But we also didnâ€™t make any changes to it.)

There is no special code for handling updates because `useEffect` handles them by default. It cleans up the previous effects before applying the next effects. To illustrate this, here is a sequence of subscribe and unsubscribe calls that this component could produce over time:

```javascript
// Mount with { friend: { id: 100 } } props
ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(100, handleStatusChange);     // Run first effect

// Update with { friend: { id: 200 } } props
ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(100, handleStatusChange); // Clean up previous effect
ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(200, handleStatusChange);     // Run next effect

// Update with { friend: { id: 300 } } props
ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(200, handleStatusChange); // Clean up previous effect
ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(300, handleStatusChange);     // Run next effect

// Unmount
ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(300, handleStatusChange); // Clean up last effect
```

This behavior ensures consistency by default and prevents bugs that are common in class components due to missing update logic.

#### Optimizing Performance by Skipping Effects

In some cases, cleaning up or applying the effect after every render might create a performance problem. In class components, we can solve this by writing an extra comparison with prevProps or prevState inside `componentDidUpdate`:

```javascript
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
  if (prevState.count !== this.state.count) {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
}
```

This requirement is common enough that it is built into the `useEffect` Hook API. You can tell React to skip applying an effect if certain values haven't changed between re-renders. To do so, pass an array as an optional second argument to `useEffect`:


```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
```

The above code, we pass `[count]` as the second argument. What does this mean? If the `count` is `5`, and then our component re-renders with count still equal to `5`, React will compare `[5]` from the previous render and [5] from the next render. Because all items in the array are the same (`5 === 5`), React would skip the effect. That's our optimization.

When we render with count updated to `6`, React will compare the items in the `[5]` array from the previous render to items in the `[6]` array from the next render. This time, React will re-apply the effect because `5 !== 6`. If there are multiple items in the array, React will re-run the effect even if just one of them is different.

This also works for effects that have a cleanup phase:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
  return () => {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
  };
}, [props.friend.id]); // Only re-subscribe if props.friend.id changes
```

In the future, the second argument might get added automatically by a build-time transformation.

### 5. Building Your Own Hooks

Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

When we were learning about using the Effect Hook, we saw this component from a chat application that displays a message indicating whether a friend is online or offline:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
```

Now let's say that our chat application also has a contact list, and we want to render names of online users with a green color.

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function FriendListItem(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    </li>
  );
}
```

W'd like to share this logic between `FriendStatus` and `FriendListItem`.

#### Extracting a Custom Hook

When we want to share logic between two JavaScript functions, we would extract it to a third function. Both components and Hooks are functions, so this works for them too.

A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with "`use`". 

For example, `useFriendStatus` below is our first custom Hook:

```javascript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);

  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });

  return isOnline;
}
```

There's nothing new inside of it, the logic is copied from the components above. Just like in a component, make sure to only call other Hooks unconditionally at the top level of your custom Hook.

We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything, it should return. In other words, it's just like a normal function. Its name should always start with `use` so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it.

The purpose of our `useFriendStatus` Hook is to subscribe us to a friend's status. This is why it takes `friendID` as an argument, and returns whether this friend is online:

```javascript
function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  
  // ...

  return isOnline;
}
```

Okay, now let's see how we can use our custom Hook.

#### Using a Custom Hook

In the beginning, our stated goal was to remove the duplicated logic from the `FriendStatus` and `FriendListItem` components. Both of them want to know whether a friend is online.

We've extracted this logic to a `useFriendStatus` hook, we can just use it:

```javascript
function FriendStatus(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
}
```

```javascript
function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);

  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    </li>
  );
}
```

Note:

Do I have to name my custom Hooks starting with "`use`"?

Without `use`, we wouldn't be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because we couldn't tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it.

Do two components using the same Hook share state?

No, custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated.

How does a custom Hook get isolated state?

Each call to a Hook gets isolated state. Because we call `useFriendStatus` directly, from React's point of view our component just calls `useState` and `useEffect`. And as we learned earlier, we can call `useState` and `useEffect` many times in one component, and they will be completely independent.

#### Pass Information Between Hooks

Since Hooks are functions, so we can pass information between them.

We'll use another component from our hypothetical chat example. This is a chat message recipient picker that displays whether the currently selected friend is online:

```javascript
const friendList = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Brian' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Ryan' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Rosa' },
];

function ChatRecipientPicker() {
  const [recipientID, setRecipientID] = useState(1);
  const isRecipientOnline = useFriendStatus(recipientID);

  return (
    <>
      <Circle color={isRecipientOnline ? 'green' : 'red'} />
      <select
        value={recipientID}
        onChange={e => setRecipientID(Number(e.target.value))}
      >
        {friendList.map(friend => (
          <option key={friend.id} value={friend.id}>
            {friend.name}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
    </>
  );
}
```

We keep the currently chosen friend ID in the `recipientID` state variable, and update it if the user chooses a different friend in the `<select>` picker.

Because the `useState` Hook call gives us the latest value of the `recipientID` state variable, we can pass it to our custom `useFriendStatus` Hook as an argument:

```javascript
const [recipientID, setRecipientID] = useState(1);
const isRecipientOnline = useFriendStatus(recipientID);
```

This lets us know whether the currently selected friend is online. If we pick a different friend and update the `recipientID` state variable, our `useFriendStatus` Hook will unsubscribe from the previously selected friend, and subscribe to the status of the newly selected one.

#### useYourImagination()

Custom Hooks offer the flexibility of sharing logic that wasn't possible in React components before.

You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more. What's more, you can build Hooks that are just as easy to use as React's built-in features.

Try to resist adding abstraction too early. Now that function components can do more, it's likely that the average function component in your codebase will become longer. This is normal â€” donâ€™t feel like you have to immediately split it into Hooks. But we also encourage you to start spotting cases where a custom Hook could hide complex logic behind a simple interface, or help untangle a messy component.

A custom Hook could hide complex logic behind a simple interface, or help untangle a messy component.

For example, maybe you have a complex component that contains a lot of local state that is managed in an ad-hoc way. `useState` doesn't make centralizing the update logic any easier so might you prefer to write it as a Redux reducer:

```javascript
function todosReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'add':
      return [...state, {
        text: action.text,
        completed: false
      }];
    // ... other actions ...
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Reducers are very convenient to test in isolation, and scale to express complex update logic. 

So what if we could write a `useReducer` Hook that lets us manage the local state of our component with a reducer? A simplified version of it might look like this:

```javascript
function useReducer(reducer, initialState) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);

  function dispatch(action) {
    const nextState = reducer(state, action);
    setState(nextState);
  }

  return [state, dispatch];
}
```

Now we could use it in our component, and let the reducer drive its state management:

```javascript
function Todos() {
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer, []);

  function handleAddClick(text) {
    dispatch({ type: 'add', text });
  }

  // ...
}
```

The need to manage local state with a reducer in a complex component is common enough that we've built the useReducer Hook right into React.
