### 6. Rules of Hooks

#### Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions:
  - Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function.
  - By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders.
  - That's what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.

#### Only Call Hooks from React Functions

Don't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:

  - Call Hooks from React function components.
  - Call Hooks from custom Hooks

#### ESLint Plugin

We released an ESLint plugin called [eslint-plugin-react-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project if youâ€™d like to try it:

```javascript
npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@next

```

Your ESLint configuration would be:

```javascript
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error"
  }
}
```

#### Explanation

As we learned earlier, we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component:

```javascript
function Form() {
  // 1. Use the name state variable
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary');

  // 2. Use an effect for persisting the form
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
  });

  // 3. Use the surname state variable
  const [surname, setSurname] = useState('Poppins');

  // 4. Use an effect for updating the title
  useEffect(function updateTitle() {
    document.title = name + ' ' + surname;
  });

  // ...
}
```

So how does React know which state corresponds to which `useState` call? The answer is that React relies on the order in which Hooks are called. Our example works because the order of the Hook calls is the same on every render:

```javascript
// ------------
// First render
// ------------
useState('Mary')           // 1. Initialize the name state variable with 'Mary'
useEffect(persistForm)     // 2. Add an effect for persisting the form
useState('Poppins')        // 3. Initialize the surname state variable with 'Poppins'
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 4. Add an effect for updating the title

// -------------
// Second render
// -------------
useState('Mary')           // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
useEffect(persistForm)     // 2. Replace the effect for persisting the form
useState('Poppins')        // 3. Read the surname state variable (argument is ignored)
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 4. Replace the effect for updating the title

// ...
```

As long as the order of the Hook calls is the same between renders, React can associate some local state with each of them. But what happens if we put a Hook call (for example, the `persistForm` effect) inside a condition?

```javascript
// ðŸ”´ We're breaking the first rule by using a Hook in a condition
if (name !== '') {
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
  });
}
```

The `name !== ''` condition is `true` on the first render, so we run this Hook. However, on the next render the user might clear the form, making the condition false. Now that we skip this Hook during rendering, the order of the Hook calls becomes different:

```javascript
useState('Mary')           // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
// useEffect(persistForm)  // ðŸ”´ This Hook was skipped!
useState('Poppins')        // ðŸ”´ 2 (but was 3). Fail to read the surname state variable
useEffect(updateTitle)     // ðŸ”´ 3 (but was 4). Fail to replace the effect
```
